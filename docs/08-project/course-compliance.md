# Course requirements and evidence

The actual teacher brief governs scoring. Original project duration: five weeks; total 10 marks, final-project weighting 50%. This package does not invent a waiver or assert implemented evidence.

| T3f | 1 | External API integration | RNT-02, RNT-14 | Kien | Use Supabase Storage API integration: auth/config, completed upload/private download, error handling/logging, tests and demo; do not claim an SDK import alone |

| T4d | 1 | API unit+integration tests | RNT-01, RNT-02, RNT-03, RNT-04, RNT-05, RNT-06, RNT-07, RNT-08, RNT-09, RNT-10, RNT-11, RNT-13, RNT-14, RNT-15, RNT-16 | Hien, Khai, Kien, Tri | Laravel API/action/policy integration coverage strictly greater than70%; real PostgreSQL race tests |
| T5a | 0.25 | Telescope | RNT-01 | Khai | Configured compatible Telescope, restricted diagnostics, useful request/query/job evidence |
| T5b | 0.25 | Error handling/logging | RNT-12 | Tri | Structured logs, friendly errors and actual critical error report/alert evidence |
| T5c | 0.25 | Slow-query alert | RNT-12 | Tri | Threshold rule and delivered deduplicated alert, not just query display |
| T5d | 0.25 | Server monitoring | RNT-12 | Tri | CPU/memory/disk/network collector and threshold alert evidence on chosen environment |
| T6a | 0.5 | Asynchronous processing | RNT-09, RNT-10 | Khai, Kien | Queue worker/outbox handling and scheduler jobs; failure/retry tests and duplicate safety |

| T6d | 0.5 | Antipattern mitigation | RNT-11, RNT-14 | Hien, Kien | Eager loading/indexes/query profiling and before/after evidence; no false optimization claims |

## Submission

- Real root application README with actual setup/tools/env/migrations/seeds/worker/scheduler/run/test instructions, overview, screenshots and ERD.
- Source repository, meaningful commits, topic branches and issue-linked reviewed PRs. Creating this pack does not establish any of them.
- Each member authors their own self-report for all five sprints. The brief states a 10% group-mark deduction for late/missing reports; collecting links does not replace personal authorship.
- Accessible public/unlisted demo link: MP4 at least 720p, no longer than 10 minutes; show real behavior/tests/docs/alerts where appropriate, not invented results.
- Demonstrate >70% UI/business coverage and separately >70% Laravel API coverage with meaningful tests; no mandatory E2E/browser automation is added by this plan.

Supabase Storage API evidence requires actual completed upload/private download and failure handling/tests, not merely an SDK dependency. Telescope is diagnostics; slow-query/critical/resource alert delivery needs actual controlled evidence. JSONB is bounded descriptive data on a relational core.
