- Evidence status: Not executed

- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR87-AC06

- Type: Integrity
- Trigger/input: Shared laundry exists but no washing machine inside requested unit
- Expected: Show shared feature separately; in-unit washing-machine filter does not match the shared facility. Apply all unit filters to same available unit.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR87-AC07

- Trigger/input: Catalog display label changes or standard enabled=false/absent
- Expected: Existing stable keys need no row migration; enabled=false/absent does not qualify for filter; absent means not advertised, not verified absent.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR87-AC08

- Expected: Unique user/property pair; first intended-state PUT returns 201, repeat returns 200.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR88-AC05

- Type: Race
- Trigger/input: Save/remove requests or responses arrive out of order
- Expected: Serialize intended state per property and reconcile with server; stale response cannot overwrite latest intent.

**Manage personal API tokens** · P0 Must

### FR89-AC01

- Type: Positive
- Trigger/input: Verified user confirms password and creates a named token with account:read and 7-day expiry
- Expected: 201 returns plaintext once over HTTPS/no-store; DB stores SHA-256 hash, UUID user reference, exact allowed abilities and finite expires_at.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR89-AC02

- Type: Privacy
- Trigger/input: Reload token list or inspect subsequent API responses, audit logs and Telescope
- Expected: Only metadata/status is shown; plaintext token, hash, cookies and password never appear. No secret is persisted in TanStack/localStorage or generic idempotency response cache.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR89-AC03

- Type: Validation
- Trigger/input: Submit missing/oversized name, empty/unknown/wildcard/admin abilities, or expiry outside 1/7/30-day choices

- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR89-AC04

- Type: Security
- Trigger/input: Attempt creation/revocation without browser session, with stale password confirmation or invalid CSRF
- Expected: Session-only guard/confirmation/CSRF rejects before mutation; API token alone cannot list, create or revoke tokens.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR89-AC05

- Type: Security
- Trigger/input: User B guesses user A token id in list/revoke
- Expected: Current-user-scoped query returns 404; no metadata leakage or foreign revocation.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR89-AC06

- Type: Positive
- Trigger/input: Revoke own token and replay it without session cookies
- Expected: 204; subsequent request returns 401. Rotation requires explicitly creating replacement and revoking old; expired token remains unusable before scheduled pruning.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR89-AC07

- Type: Failure
- Trigger/input: Token creation response is lost after commit
- Expected: Do not automatically retry or recover secret from storage; show metadata on refresh, allow revoke and explicit new creation. No plaintext replay record exists.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR89-AC08

- Type: Security
- Trigger/input: Reset password or suspend account with live sessions and tokens
- Expected: Revoke all PATs and sessions as part of the security action; active-account middleware blocks suspended users immediately on new requests. Re-enabling an account does not restore revoked tokens.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR90-AC01

- Type: Positive
- Trigger/input: Browser gets /sanctum/csrf-cookie then submits an allowed form with credentials and matching X-XSRF-TOKEN

- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR90-AC02

- Type: Security
- Trigger/input: Submit login and representative authenticated POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests with missing/wrong/other-session CSRF
- Expected: 419 on Laravel baseline; no database/audit/outbox/storage side effects. Test CSRF middleware with the framework test bypass explicitly disabled.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR90-AC03

- Type: Security
- Trigger/input: Cross-site form sends victim session cookies without correct CSRF
- Expected: No state change; no blanket CSRF exemption on api/* or authentication endpoints. CORS does not substitute for CSRF validation.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR90-AC04

- Type: Positive
- Trigger/input: Cookie-free non-browser request uses a valid favourites:write token on the approved route
- Expected: Succeeds subject to scope/Policy without CSRF cookie. A disallowed browser origin or mixed stale session request cannot turn into a CSRF bypass.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR90-AC05

- Type: Failure
- Trigger/input: Session/CSRF expires while filling a form
- Expected: Show 401/419 recovery feedback, preserve safe input, reinitialize/login as needed and ask for explicit resubmission; do not blindly repeat contract or other writes.
- Evidence status: Not executed

### FR90-AC06

- Type: Deployment
- Trigger/input: Test localhost ports and production sibling subdomains with exact credentialed CORS settings
- Expected: Cookies, XSRF header, allowed origins and stateful host:port list agree; HTTPS Secure cookie works. Unrelated default domains fail the deployment checklist until a documented same-origin proxy/domain arrangement is implemented.
- Evidence status: Not executed
